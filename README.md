### Adopt a Buddy
  Welcome to Adopt a Buddy! This project is built using the MERN stack and aims to connect people with their future pets. Our platform categorizes pets into dogs, cats, and other animals, allowing users to easily browse through them. If a user is interested in adopting a pet, they can fill out an adoption form and will receive a confirmation message that their adoption request has been submitted.

## Features
# Browse Pets:
  - Users can explore the available pets categorized by dogs, cats, and other animals.
# Adoption Form: 
  - Users interested in adopting a pet can fill out an adoption form.
# Adoption Request Confirmation: 
  - After submitting the form, users receive a message confirming their adoption request.
    
# Project Structure
The project is organized into two main parts: the client (frontend) and the server (backend).

The client directory contains the React application which includes components, pages, and the main app configuration.
The server directory contains the Node.js and Express backend, including database configurations, API controllers, models, and routes.
How to Get Started
Clone the repository: Download the project to your local machine using the command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adopt-a-buddy.git
Install dependencies: Navigate to both the client and server directories and run npm install to install all necessary dependencies.

Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the server directory with your MongoDB URI and the port number you wish to use.

Run the application: Start the backend server by navigating to the server directory and running npm start. In a separate terminal, start the frontend by navigating to the client directory and running npm start. Your application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
